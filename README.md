# [zone-blitz](https://zoneblitz.app/)

A free (as in freedom _and_ beer) and open source american football general
manager simulator, built entirely with and served on web technologies!

## Description

You can think of this simulator as being the american football version of
popular games like
[Out of the Park Baseball](https://www.ootpdevelopments.com/out-of-the-park-baseball-home/)
or [Football Manager](https://www.footballmanager.com/).

### Status

Zone Blitz is in a pre-alpha stage of development, and still needs to implement
even basic business logic. See [roadmap](./docs/roadmap.md) for more details!

## [Documentation](./docs/README.md)

If you wish to learn in great (and sometimes verbose) detail more about the
technical direction, product roadmap, explanations of decisions made, or want to
learn about my mindset with developing software products do check out the
[documentation](./docs/README.md)!
