## Philosophy

Overall, the philosophy of Zone Blitz pre-alpha is to build a simple, cheap, and developer
friendly experience in order to release quickly and cheaply, with the trade off of potentially
having future scale and performance issues if heavy traffic occurs. **If Zone Blitz is having
scale issues, this is a very good problem to have, it means the product is a hit ðŸ˜„**. We can always
vertically scale while detailing a strategy to horizontally scale.
