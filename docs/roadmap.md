# Roadmap

Zone Blitz still has a _ways_ to go, and is **currently not a working proof-of-concept product**. Progress
is being made steadily though! Below are the high level goals I wish to accomplish before calling
Zone Blitz a working minimum viable alpha proof-of-concept:

- Game logic and rules engine with accurate and realistic statistics.
- Management logic to set depth charts, rosters, coaching staffs, free agency, and drafting.
- Player progression and regression based on performance, age, and other factors.
- Ability to simulate full seasons with AI / CPU managed teams with working year-to-year progression and schedule management.
- Web interface for users to login and manage their leagues and teams.

For an alpha launch, the above goals are going to be purposefully _just good enough_ in exchange
for getting a working proof-of-concept out soon.

Beta launch will start to really hone in and refine the quality of the goals above, along with
brainstorming some brand new, innovative goals.
