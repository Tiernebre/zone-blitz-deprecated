/**
 * Contains all the specific route and endpoint builders for Zone Blitz.
 *
 * Typically, a "route" in the context of this package is an EndpointGroup
 * that defines the URI and HTTP method pathing.
 *
 * The routes defined here are not coupled to the implementation details of
 * the controller and how the requests and responses are handled. Their
 * single conern is to map the specific URI resource path to an injected
 * controller.
